<b>Basics of the Web</b>
<br>
I found this introduction to be enlightening, as it shows what goes on behind the scenes. Our browers are only windows to the vast world wide web out there.<br>
We can point our browsers to one exact location, which is HTML, or <em>hypertext markup language.</em> From there, servers understand this query and send it back to the user.<br>
<br>
<b>HTML</b>
<br>As Andy pointed out in his notes, HTML is the documentation style that is used for anything on the internet.  It is based on the text (what one sees) and the markup language (the fun stuff that this course will consist of.
<br>
<br>
<b>Computer Logic</b>
<br>
I understand we'll delve into other languages as well, and a lot of this theory could be universally applied. After all, computers are stupid.
<br>
Well...rather they are literal machines. Meaning that correct programming can be imminently useful for getting computers to work the way we want them to work.

<b>Basic Vocabulary</b>
We covered a few things:
<br>
1: Tags
<div>This spices up our code. Want <em>italics?</em> <b>bold?</b></div> these are what will designate certain...
<br>
2: Elements
<div>A continous sequence of code. I think of it as a sentence within the markup language we are writing.</div>
3: Attributes
<div>These are modifiers to basic elements (such as an anchor link, img, and the like)</div>
<br>
<b>Inline vs. Block Elements</b>
<br>
We had a helpful exercise towards the end of the lesson that showed us that certain tags will stay within the line of code, while <div>others will designate 'blocks' within the code. This is the main distinction between the two elements.</div>
